      This page has been updated as part of IS 436 Lab 5.  
      The Docker image was rebuilt automatically using GitHub Actions and pushed to DockerHub,  
      and this live site is running on Render's cloud platform.

    <p>
      Cloud deployment ensures high availability, easy scaling, and continuous integration.  
      Every push to <strong>main</strong> will automatically trigger a new image build and update.
